<h1> Do While Structure In Python</h1> <h4>Using Recursive Functions, with three examples for three different situtations</h4> <hr>
<h2>Main Objective</h2>
<li>All those examples aims to create an exact version of do while, which is a helpful structure in c, js etc...  or to add/upgrade it much as we can.</li>
<li>All those examples used kept simple for everyone to understand rapidly.</li>

<h2> dofunc Function Explanation</h2>
This function's job is to get 2 numbers and print the product of those 2 numbers for one time.
First, we take 2 numbers and print the production of them. Then, we ask user to continue and do one more examples. 
If the answer is y, then we call the function again.
<h2>cleardo Function Explanation</h2>
This function is coded to show that you can use use global variables with DoWhile. 

Why is it necessary?
Because you might need to use thhe variable inside this dowhile function after the execution.

<h2>returndo Function Explanation</h2>
This function returns a value after do while is completed and while condition is no longer valid. 
Similar to cleardo function, instead of using a global variable, we use return there.

<h2>Possible Improvements</h2>
<li>You can add print inside to while blocks, or a lot of things inside while blocks.
